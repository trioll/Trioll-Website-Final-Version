# Custom Authorizer Implementation Summary

## What We Built

A **custom Lambda authorizer** that allows both authenticated users and guest users to send analytics events, solving the 403 Forbidden errors without compromising security.

## How It Works

```
User Request → API Gateway → Custom Authorizer → Analytics Lambda → DynamoDB
```

1. **User sends request** with either:
   - `Authorization: Bearer guest-{id}` (guest users)
   - `Authorization: Bearer eyJ...` (Cognito JWT token)

2. **Custom Authorizer validates**:
   - Guest tokens: Checks format, allows if valid
   - JWT tokens: Validates with Cognito (signature, expiry, etc.)

3. **Passes context to Lambda**:
   ```json
   {
     "userId": "guest-123" or "cognito-user-id",
     "isGuest": "true" or "false",
     "authType": "guest" or "cognito"
   }
   ```

4. **Analytics Lambda** uses this context instead of parsing tokens itself

## Files Created

### 1. `custom-authorizer.js`
- Main authorizer logic
- Validates both token types
- Returns IAM policy (Allow/Deny)
- Caches results for 1 hour

### 2. `analytics-api-with-authorizer.js`
- Updated analytics Lambda
- Uses authorizer context
- No longer needs to parse Authorization header
- Tracks `isGuest` flag with all events

### 3. `pre-deployment-checks.sh`
- Safety checks before deployment
- Verifies current configuration
- Tests existing endpoints
- Checks dependencies

### 4. `safe-deployment.sh`
- Step-by-step deployment
- Confirms each step
- Tests after each change
- Creates rollback commands

## Security Considerations

✅ **What's Maintained:**
- Cognito tokens fully validated (signature, expiry, issuer)
- Each request still requires authentication (even guests)
- Analytics events tagged with user type
- No anonymous access

✅ **What's New:**
- Guest tokens accepted but tracked separately
- Context passed securely from authorizer to Lambda
- 1-hour cache for performance
- Failed auth not cached

## Deployment Process

1. **Run pre-checks**: `./pre-deployment-checks.sh`
2. **Deploy safely**: `./safe-deployment.sh`
3. **Monitor logs** during deployment
4. **Test both token types**
5. **Re-enable frontend analytics**

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
```bash
# Authorizer performance
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/trioll-custom-authorizer --follow

# Analytics processing
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/trioll-prod-analytics-api --follow

# API Gateway metrics
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/ApiGateway \
  --metric-name 4XXError \
  --dimensions Name=ApiName,Value=trioll-prod-api
```

## Frontend Changes

Once deployed, update `analytics.js`:
```javascript
// Remove these lines:
// Logger.log('Analytics: Temporarily disabled to avoid 403 errors');
// this.events = [];
// return;
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback commands are saved to `rollback-commands.txt`:
1. Remove authorizer from endpoint
2. Redeploy API Gateway
3. Restore original Lambda

## Benefits

1. **Guest Analytics Work**: No more 403 errors
2. **Better User Tracking**: Can follow guest → registered journey
3. **Improved Security**: Centralized auth validation
4. **Performance**: 1-hour auth cache
5. **Maintainability**: Single place for auth logic

## Testing

The deployment script tests automatically, but you should also:

1. **Test Guest Token**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://4ib0hvu1xj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/analytics/events \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer guest-web123" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"events": [{"event": "test_guest"}]}'
   ```

2. **Test Real JWT** (from browser console):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://4ib0hvu1xj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/analytics/events \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ..." \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"events": [{"event": "test_auth"}]}'
   ```

## Success Metrics

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ No more 403 errors in browser console
- ✅ Guest events appearing in DynamoDB with `isGuest: true`
- ✅ Auth cache hit rate > 80% in CloudWatch
- ✅ Both button clicks and analytics working
